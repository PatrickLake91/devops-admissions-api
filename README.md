# Admissions Eligibility Checker API

This project is a small Flask-based web API that estimates a pupil's National Curriculum (NC) year from their age or date of birth. 

It is used as the case study for the DevOps WRIT1 assessment, demonstrating a full CI/CD pipeline using Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS EC2.
